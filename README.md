# Trash Classification Notebook

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates a machine learning model for classifying trash types using an image dataset. The notebook provides an overview of the image preprocessing, model architecture, and model evaluation steps. It also includes an example of how to predict the trash type of a randomly selected image from the dataset.

## Overview

1. **Import Libraries:** Import necessary libraries for image processing, data visualization, and machine learning.

2. **Load Data:** Load the trash dataset into the notebook.

3. **Explore Data:** Explore the dataset to understand the structure and classes.

4. **Preprocess Data:** Preprocess the dataset by resizing the images to a standard size, and normalizing the pixel values.

5. **Define Model:** Define a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for the image classification task.

6. **Compile Model:** Compile the model by specifying the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metric.

7. **Train Model:** Train the model using the preprocessed dataset.

8. **Evaluate Model:** Evaluate the model's performance by calculating the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

9. **Predict Trash Type:** Predict the trash type of a randomly selected image from the dataset and display the prediction result.

10. **Visualize Results:** Visualize the predictions and the ground truth.

## Running the Notebook

1. **Open the Notebook:** Open the trash_classification.ipynb file in a Jupyter notebook environment.

2. **Run Cells:** Run each cell in the notebook one by one. This will execute the code and display the results in each cell.

3. **Analyze Results:** Analyze the predictions and evaluation metrics to understand the model's performance.

Please note that running this notebook may take some time, depending on your machine's hardware capabilities. Additionally, if you encounter any errors while running the notebook, make sure you have installed all the necessary libraries, such as `tensorflow`, `matplotlib`, and `keras`. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib keras
